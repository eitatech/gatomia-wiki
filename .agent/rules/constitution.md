# GatomIA Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Purpose

This constitution establishes the foundational coding standards and practices for the GatomIA project. It aims to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase while fostering a collaborative and efficient development environment.

### II. Scope
notes
This constitution applies to all source code, tests, documentation, and configuration files within the GatomIA project. It governs naming conventions, coding practices, testing strategies, and overall code quality standards.

### III. Definitions

- **Documentation**: Written descriptions and explanations of code functionality, usage, and architecture.
- **Language**: All documentation and code comments MUST be written in English.
- **Source Files**: All files containing code, including but not limited to `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.json`, and configuration files.

### IV. Kebab-Case File Naming (NON-NEGOTIABLE, MANDATORY)

**Rule**: All source files MUST follow kebab-case naming convention.

**Rationale**: Ensures consistency across the codebase, prevents linting errors, and maintains compatibility with various file systems and tooling. Files in kebab-case are easier to read, predict, and locate.

**Enforcement**:

- Linter MUST fail on any file not following kebab-case
- Code reviews MUST reject PRs with non-compliant file names
- Automated checks MUST validate file naming before merge

**Examples**:

- ✅ `preview-store.ts`, `document-preview-panel.ts`, `hook-executor.ts`
- ❌ `previewStore.ts`, `DocumentPreviewPanel.ts`, `hook_executor.ts`

**Exceptions**: Configuration files that require specific naming (e.g., `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `README.md`)

### V. TypeScript-First Development

**Rule**: All source code MUST be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled.

**Rationale**: Type safety prevents runtime errors, improves code maintainability, enables better IDE support, and serves as living documentation.

**Enforcement**:

- `strict: true` in tsconfig.json is non-negotiable
- No `any` types without explicit justification in code review
- All public APIs MUST have complete type definitions

### VI. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Rule**: Tests MUST be written and approved BEFORE implementation begins.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures requirements are clear, code is testable, and functionality is verified from the start. It prevents scope creep and reduces debugging time.

**Enforcement**:

- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced
- PRs without corresponding tests are automatically rejected
- Test coverage MUST not decrease with new changes
- Integration tests required for new features and contract changes

### VII. Observability & Instrumentation

**Rule**: All significant operations MUST include appropriate telemetry, logging, and error reporting.

**Rationale**: Enables debugging in production, monitors performance targets, and provides insights into user behavior and system health.

**Enforcement**:

- Performance-critical paths MUST include instrumentation
- Errors MUST be logged with sufficient context for debugging
- Success criteria from specifications MUST be measurable via telemetry

### VIII. Simplicity & YAGNI

**Rule**: Implement only what is needed now. Do not add features or abstractions for potential future use.

**Rationale**: Prevents over-engineering, reduces complexity, keeps codebase maintainable, and accelerates delivery.

**Enforcement**:

- Code reviews MUST challenge unnecessary abstractions
- Features without current use cases are rejected
- Refactoring happens when patterns emerge (Rule of Three)

## Code Quality Standards (MANDATORY - NON NEGOTIABLE)

### Formatting & Style

**Requirements**:

- Tab indentation (configured in formatter)
- Double quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- Formatter (`npm run format`) MUST pass before commit
- Linter (`npm run lint`) MUST pass before merge
- Validation (`npm run check`) MUST pass before mark the task as completed
- Never use emoji in source code files (from global user instructions).

### Documentation

**Requirements**:

- Public APIs MUST include JSDoc comments
- Complex algorithms MUST include explanatory comments
- README files MUST be kept up-to-date with feature changes
- Breaking changes MUST be documented in CHANGELOG
- Architecture decisions MUST be recorded in ADRs
- All documentation MUST be in English

### Error Handling

**Requirements**:

- All async operations MUST handle errors explicitly
- User-facing errors MUST be actionable and clear
- Internal errors MUST include sufficient debug context
- No silent failures
- Use custom error classes for domain-specific errors
- Logging of errors MUST follow the observability guidelines
- Graceful degradation strategies MUST be implemented where applicable
- Retry logic MUST be applied for transient failures
- Validation of inputs MUST be performed to prevent unexpected errors
- Fallback mechanisms MUST be in place for critical operations
- Error handling strategies MUST be reviewed during code reviews

## Governance

### Amendment Process

**Procedure**:

1. Proposed change documented with rationale
2. Team discussion and approval
3. Migration plan for existing code (if needed)
4. Constitution version increment (semantic versioning)
5. Update LAST_AMENDED_DATE

### Compliance

**Requirements**:

- All PRs MUST verify compliance with constitution principles
- Violations MUST be justified and documented
- Repeated violations trigger architecture review
- Constitution supersedes conflicting practices
